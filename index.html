               <b> 8.6.2 Founder's Archives:</b> <br>
                Bock can establish a dedicated archive or repository to preserve and organise the
                Founder's personal and professional materials, including speeches, letters,
                documents, and memorabilia. This archive can serve as a valuable resource for
                understanding the Founder's thinking and contributions to the company. <br><br>

                <b>8.6.3 Leadership Case Studies:</b> <br>
                Bock can develop case studies based on the Founder's leadership decisions and
                strategies. These case studies can be used in training programs, workshops, and
                internal discussions to share the Founder's wisdom and insights with current and
                future leaders. <br><br>

               <b> 8.6.4 Founder's Values Integration:</b> <br>
                Bock can integrate the Founder's core values and principles into its employee
                onboarding, training programs, and company culture. This integration can be done
                through explicit discussions, case studies, and examples of how these values have
                guided the company's decisions and actions. <br><br>

               <b> 8.6.5 Founder's Recognition Events:</b> <br>
                Bock can organise special events and celebrations to commemorate the Founder's
                contributions and impact on the company. These events can serve to honour the
                Founder's legacy and inspire current and future employees to embody the same
                values and dedication. <br>
                By implementing these initiatives, Bock can ensure that the Founder's legacy lives
                on, shaping the company's culture, inspiring its leaders, and guiding its continued

            <p>
                <b>9.1 Eligibility and Recognition </b><br>
                The designation of Co-Founder is reserved for individuals who demonstrate
                exceptional dedication, support, and contributions to Bock during the early stages of
                its development. These individuals play a crucial role in shaping the company's
                direction, establishing its foundations, and driving its growth. <br><br>

                <b>9.1.1 Identifying Co-Founders </b><br>
                The Founder will identify potential co-founders based on their observations and
                interactions with individuals during the internship program and the company's early
                growth phase. Key factors considered include: <br>
                ● Exceptional dedication and support: Co-founders should demonstrate
                unwavering commitment to the company's success, consistently going above
                and beyond expectations. <br>
                ● Strategic contributions and insights: Co-founders should provide valuable
                strategic insights, actively participating in shaping the company's direction and
                decision-making processes. <br>
                ● Leadership qualities and influence: Co-founders should exhibit strong
                leadership qualities, inspiring and motivating others to contribute to the
                company's goals. <br>
                ● Alignment with the company's vision and values: Co-founders should deeply
                understand and align with the company's core values and vision for the future. <br><br>

                <b>9.1.2 Recognizing Co-Founders </b><br>
                Once identified, co-founders will be formally recognized and granted the designation
                of Co-Founder. This recognition acknowledges their significant contributions and
                elevates their status within the company. <br><br> <br>

                <b>9.1.2 Recognizing Co-Founders </b><br>
                Share allocation within Bock is carefully considered to ensure a fair and equitable
                distribution of ownership among key stakeholders. The majority of shares will be held
                by the Board of Directors and CEOs, reflecting their leadership roles and
                contributions to the company's success. <br> <br>

                <b>9.2.1 Share Allocation to Directors and CEOs </b><br>
                Out of the total number of issued shares, 75% will be allocated to the Board of
                Directors and CEOs. This distribution recognizes their critical roles in overseeing the
                company's strategic direction and managing its operations effectively. <br>

                <b>9.2.2 Share Allocation to Co-Founders</b> <br>
                The remaining 25% of shares will be allocated to the Co-Founders, acknowledging
                their significant contributions during the company's early stages. The specific
                allocation among Co-Founders will be determined based on their individual
                contributions and the Founder's assessment. <br> <br>

                <b>9.2.2 Share Allocation to Co-Founders</b><br>
                To ensure stability and prevent premature dilution of ownership, restrictions will be
                placed on the transfer of shares. Co-Founders will have limited ability to transfer their
                shares without the Founder's approval. This is to protect the company's long-term
                interests and ensure that ownership remains aligned with the company's vision and
                goals. <br> <br>

                <b>9.2.4 Investor Involvement and Share Allocation</b> <br>
                In the event of an investor joining Bock, the company may issue additional shares to
                accommodate the investor's participation. The allocation of shares to investors will
                be determined through negotiations and will depend on the terms of the investment
                agreement. <br> <br>

                <b>9.3 Other Employees and Share Allocation</b> <br>
                Employees other than the Board of Directors, CEOs, and Co-Founders will not have
                direct ownership in the company until an investor joins. This is to maintain a clear
                ownership structure and ensure that the company's focus remains on achieving its
                objectives and establishing a strong foundation for future growth. <br> <br>

                <b>9.3.1 Future Share Allocation</b> <br>
                Once the company has achieved significant milestones and established a stable
                financial footing, it may consider implementing an employee stock ownership plan
                (ESOP) or other mechanisms to provide ownership opportunities for a broader range
                of employees. This will be subject to the company's financial performance, regulatory
                considerations, and the approval of the Board of Directors.
                By implementing these share allocation guidelines, Bock aims to strike a balance
                between recognizing the contributions of key stakeholders and ensuring the
                company's long-term stability and growth prospects. <br> <br>
                
                <b>9.4 Employee Incentives and Recognition</b><br>
                Beyond share allocation, Bock recognizes the importance of providing non-equity
                incentives to motivate and reward employees for their contributions to the company's
                success. These incentives can take various forms, including: <br> <br>
                9.4.1 Performance-Based Bonuses: Bock may implement performance-based
                bonus programs to reward employees who exceed expectations and achieve their
                performance goals. These bonuses can be based on individual and team
                performance metrics, aligning incentives with the company's overall objectives. <br> <br>

                <b>9.4.2 Profit-Sharing Plans</b>: As the company grows and becomes profitable, Bock
                may consider implementing a profit-sharing plan to share a portion of its profits with
                its employees. This can foster a sense of ownership and participation in the
                company's success. <br> <br>

                <b>9.4.3 Non-Monetary Recognition</b>: Bock recognizes the value of non-monetary
                forms of recognition, such as public acknowledgments, awards, and opportunities for
                professional development. These gestures can significantly boost employee morale
                and motivation. <br> <br>

                <b>9.4.4 Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP)</b>: As Bock matures and achieves
                financial stability, it may consider establishing an ESOP to provide broader
                ownership opportunities for its employees. This can further align employee interests
                with the company's long-term success. <br>
                By implementing a comprehensive incentive program that includes both equity and
                non-equity rewards, Bock can effectively attract, retain, and motivate top talent,
                fostering a culture of engagement and driving the company's continued growth.

            <p>
               <b> 10.1 Share Allocation Principles <br><br></b>
                Share allocation within Bock is a carefully considered process that aims to strike a
                balance between recognizing the contributions of key stakeholders and ensuring the
                company's long-term stability and growth prospects. The following principles guide
                share allocation decisions: <br><br>
                ● Recognizing Key Stakeholders: The majority of shares are allocated to the
                Board of Directors, CEOs, and Co-Founders, reflecting their leadership roles,
                strategic contributions, and unwavering commitment to the company's
                success. <br><br>
                ● Aligning Incentives with Performance: To further align employee interests with
                the company's long-term objectives, Bock implements performance-based
                bonus programs, profit-sharing plans, and non-monetary recognition
                programs. These incentives motivate employees to exceed expectations,
                contribute to the company's growth, and share in its success. <br><br>
                ● Ensuring Stability and Growth: To maintain a stable ownership structure and
                protect the company's long-term interests, Bock places restrictions on share
                transfer. Additionally, careful consideration is given to employee ownership
                opportunities, ensuring that equity-based incentives are aligned with the
                company's growth trajectory and financial stability. <br><br>

               <b> 10.2 Founder's Discretionary Share Exchange <br><br></b>
                The Founder's role extends beyond share allocation, encompassing the authority to
                exchange shares with other Directors and CEOs. No one can exchange their shares
                without the founder's approval. This discretionary power allows for flexibility and
                adaptability in the company's ownership structure, enabling the Founder to respond
                to changing circumstances and strategic considerations. <br><br>

               <b> 10.2.1 Threshold Valuation and Share Exchange <br><br></b>
                Upon reaching a threshold valuation of ₹100 Crore, the Founder has the option to
                exchange their shares with the Directors and CEOs of individual subsidiary
                companies. This exchange is contingent upon the Founder offering the equivalent
                monetary value to repurchase the shares. <br><br>

               <b> 10.2.2 Share Exchange and Employee Incentives <br><br></b>
                When the Founder exchanges shares with the CEO of a particular subsidiary
                company, the funds received are distributed equally among the employees, including
                Program Managers, Project Managers, and Engineers. This distribution recognizes
                and rewards the collective contributions of the subsidiary team to achieving the
                company's milestones. <br><br>

                <b>10.2.3 Share Retention and Negotiation <br><br></b>
                Directors and CEOs have the right to negotiate with the Founder to retain their
                shares, even after reaching the threshold valuation. However, the ultimate decision
                on share retention rests with the Founder, reflecting their authority and responsibility
                to make strategic decisions for the company's long-term benefit. <br><br>

              <b>  10.3 Founder's Authority and Decision-Making <br><br></b>
                The Founder's authority extends beyond share allocation, encompassing various
                aspects of the company's operations and decision-making. Their role and
                responsibilities include: <br><br>
                ● Vision and Mission Stewardship: The Founder safeguards Bock's core values,
                ensuring that the company's vision and mission remain at the forefront of all
                decision-making. This ensures that the company's growth and strategic
                direction remain aligned with its founding principles. <br><br>
                ● Strategic Guidance and Leadership: The Founder provides strategic guidance
                and leadership, steering the company towards long-term objectives and
                ensuring that Bock remains competitive in the ever-evolving technology
                landscape. <br><br>
                ● Internal Dispute Resolution: In the event of internal disputes among the Board
                of Directors, the Founder has the authority to intervene and resolve the issue.
                This ensures stability and unity within the company, preventing internal
                conflicts from hindering its progress. <br><br>
                ● Succession Planning and Legacy Preservation: The Founder establishes a
                succession plan to guarantee a smooth transition of leadership and safeguard
                Bock's stability and growth. Additionally, they implement initiatives to preserve
                their legacy, embedding their values in the company culture and inspiring
                future leaders to carry on their vision. <br><br>
                By effectively utilising their authority and decision-making power, the Founder plays
                a crucial role in shaping Bock's direction, fostering a culture of innovation, and
                ensuring the company's long-term success. <br><br>

               <b> 10.4 Founder's Authority to Appoint and Remove Directors and CEOs <br><br></b>
                The Founder holds the ultimate authority to appoint and remove Directors and
                CEOs, both in the parent company and individual subsidiary companies. This
                authority ensures that the company's leadership aligns with the Founder's vision,
                strategic direction, and commitment to Bock's long-term success. <br><br>

               <b> 10.4.1 Appointment Process <br><br></b>
                The Founder carefully selects and appoints Directors and CEOs based on their
                qualifications, experience, leadership potential, and alignment with the company's
                values and objectives. This selection process ensures that the company's leadership
                team possesses the necessary skills, expertise, and vision to guide Bock towards its
                strategic goals. <br><br>

              <b>  10.4.2 Performance Evaluation and Removal <br><br></b>
                The Founder regularly evaluates the performance of Directors and CEOs, assessing
                their contributions to the company's growth, strategic execution, and adherence to
                Bock's core values. If a Director or CEO fails to meet the Founder's expectations or
                demonstrates behaviour that contradicts the company's principles, the Founder has
                the authority to remove them from their position. <br><br>

              <b>  10.4.3 Ensuring Stability and Unity <br><br></b>
                The Founder's authority to appoint and remove Directors and CEOs maintains
                stability and unity within the company. This authority prevents power struggles,
                ensures that leadership decisions are aligned with the company's long-term
                objectives, and fosters a culture of accountability and high performance. <br><br>

             <b>   10.4.4 Transparency and Communication <br><br></b>
                The Founder exercises their authority in a transparent and communicative manner,
                keeping the Board of Directors, CEOs, and employees informed of their decisions
                and the rationale behind them. This transparency fosters trust, builds confidence in
                the company's leadership, and ensures that all stakeholders understand the direction
                of the company. <br><br>

              <b>  10.4.5 Balancing Authority with Respect <br><br></b>
                The Founder exercises their authority with respect and consideration for the
                contributions and perspectives of Directors and CEOs. They maintain open
                communication channels, value diverse opinions, and strive to reach consensus
                whenever possible. This balanced approach fosters a collaborative leadership
                environment where individual expertise and collective wisdom can contribute to the
                company's success. <br><br>

               <b> 10.5 Founder's Role in Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) <br><br></b>
                The Founder plays a pivotal role in guiding Bock through mergers and acquisitions
                (M&A) activities. Their vision, strategic acumen, and understanding of the company's
                long-term objectives are crucial for identifying and evaluating potential M&A
                opportunities. <br><br>

               <b> 10.5.1 Identifying Strategic Opportunities <br><br></b>
                The Founder proactively identifies potential M&A opportunities that align with Bock's
                strategic goals and expansion plans. This may involve assessing market trends,
                analysing emerging technologies, and exploring partnerships with complementary
                companies. <br><br>

              <b>  10.5.2 Evaluating Potential Targets <br><br></b>
                The Founder thoroughly evaluates potential M&A targets, considering factors such
                as financial viability, market position, technological capabilities, cultural compatibility,
                and potential synergies. This rigorous evaluation ensures that potential acquisitions
                align with Bock's strategic direction and contribute to its long-term success <br><br>

               <b> 10.5.3 Negotiating and Structuring Deals <br><br></b>
                The Founder leads the negotiation process with potential M&A partners, securing
                favourable terms and conditions that protect Bock's interests and maximise the value
                of the transaction. They may also collaborate with legal and financial experts to
                structure deals that meet regulatory requirements and align with the company's
                financial objectives. <br><br>

               <b> 10.5.4 Integration and Post-Merger Success <br><br></b>
                The Founder oversees the integration process, ensuring that the newly acquired
                company is seamlessly integrated into Bock's operations and culture. They address
                potential challenges, foster collaboration between teams, and communicate the
                strategic rationale for the merger to all employees. Their leadership is crucial for
                ensuring a successful post-merger integration and realising the full value of the
                acquisition. <br><br>

             <b>   10.5.5 Protecting Bock's Interests and Legacy</b>
                Throughout the M&A process, the Founder prioritises Bock's long-term interests and

                preserving Bock's identity and ensuring that M&A activities contribute to the
                company's sustainable growth and success. <br><br>

                    completion of the internship program, Bock offers eligible interns full-time
                    employment opportunities as engineers, regardless of whether they possess an
                    equivalent engineering degree. This reflects the company's recognition of the
                    practical skills and knowledge gained during the internship program. <br><br>

                    <b>18.1 Mandatory Internship Completion </b><br>
                    To be eligible for full-time employment as an engineer, interns must successfully
                    complete the entire internship program. This requirement ensures that interns have

                    Interns who have only completed the internship program are not eligible for company
                    shares. This policy aims to differentiate between internships, which provide valuable

                    ● 2026 graduates: 3 years <br>
                    ● 2027 graduates: 4 years <br>

                    <b>18.5 Unbreakable Bond and Legal Consequences</b> <br>
                    The bond agreement is legally binding and cannot be broken without valid
                    justification. Any breach of the bond agreement may result in legal action and
                    financial penalties, including reimbursement for training costs, internship expenses,

                    Interns transitioning into full-time employment must seek prior approval from the

                    <b>18.7 Mandatory Participation in Competitions and Events</b> <br>
                    Full-time employees are expected to actively participate in various international,
                    national, and regional hackathons and competitions organised by the company. This
                    participation aims to foster teamwork, enhance technical skills, and promote the

                    ensures that external commitments do not interfere with the employee's primary
                    responsibilities at Bock. <br><br>

                    <b>18.9 Penalty for Non-Compliance</b> <br>
                    Failure to comply with the above rules regarding external employment and
                    participation in competitions may result in financial penalties for the employee. This
                    policy emphasises the importance of prioritising the company's interests and
                    upholding the terms of the bond agreement. <br>
                    By implementing these employment policies, Bock strives to maintain a balance
                    between providing opportunities for its interns and protecting the company's
                    interests. The mandatory internship completion requirement ensures that interns are
                    adequately prepared for full-time employment, while the bond agreement safeguards
                    the company's investment in their training and development. Additionally, the
                    guidelines for external employment and participation in competitions promote
                    teamwork, collaboration, and the company's reputation in the industry.

                    provide employees with opportunities to enhance their skills, collaborate with
                    colleagues, and contribute to the company's reputation in the industry. Therefore, all
                    employees are required to attend these company-allotted activities, as they are
                    essential for individual and organisational growth. Non-attendance without valid
                    justification may result in disciplinary action. <br><br>

                    <b>25.3 Notice Period for Resignation <br></b>
                    To ensure a smooth transition of responsibilities and maintain continuity of
                    operations, Bock requires employees intending to resign from their positions to
                    provide a written notice period of at least 30 days. This notice period allows the
                    company to identify and recruit a suitable replacement, minimising disruptions to
                    ongoing projects and team dynamics. Failure to provide proper notice may result in
                    disciplinary action, as it demonstrates a lack of consideration for the company's
                    needs and hinders its ability to maintain operational efficiency. <br><br>

                    <b>25.4 Reimbursement of Training and Certification Costs for Early Leavers <br></b>
                    Bock invests significantly in the training and development of its employees, providing
                    them with the skills and knowledge necessary to excel in their roles. To protect its
                    investment and ensure that employees fulfil their commitment to the company, Bock
                    has implemented a policy that requires employees who leave the company before
                    completing their agreed-upon serving period mentioned in their employment
                    agreement bond to reimburse the company for the costs incurred on their training
                    and certifications. This policy ensures that the company recoups its investment in the
                    employee's development and encourages employees to fulfil their obligations. <br><br>

                    <b>25.5 Performance Warnings and Termination <br></b>
                    Bock is committed to maintaining a high-performance work environment and expects
                    its employees to meet performance expectations consistently. However, if an
                    employee consistently fails to meet performance expectations or demonstrates a
                    lack of commitment to their work, they may receive warnings. Warnings serve as a
                    formal notification of performance issues and provide an opportunity for
                    improvement. If an employee receives five warnings within a specified period, their
                    employment may be terminated by the consultation of all board members. The
                    employee will still be responsible for reimbursing the company for training and
                    certification costs in this case. Termination is a last resort and is taken only when an
                    employee's performance or behaviour is detrimental to the company's overall
                    success. <br><br>

                    By adhering to these general rules, employees can contribute to a positive,
                    productive, and respectful work culture at Bock. These rules promote open
                    communication, responsible behaviour, a commitment to the company's success,
                    and a culture of continuous learning and improvement.

                    Beyond the comprehensive policies and procedures outlined in the preceding
                    sections, Bock has also established a set of general rules to foster a professional,
                    productive, and harmonious work environment. These rules apply to all employees
                    and are designed to promote respect, responsibility, and accountability. <br><br>

                    <b> 26.1 Prompt Communication and Collaboration <br> </b>
                    Bock values timely and effective communication among its employees. To maintain
                    open communication channels and ensure that urgent matters are addressed
                    promptly, all employees are expected to respond to work-related communications,
                    including WhatsApp messages, text messages, emails, and phone calls, within 24
                    hours. This promptness fosters collaboration, efficient workflow, and timely resolution
                    of issues. <br><br>

                    <b> 26.2 Continuous Learning and Skill Development <br> </b>
                    Bock is committed to continuous learning, skill development, and fostering a culture

                    <b> 26.3 Smooth Transition of Responsibilities <br> </b>
                    To ensure a smooth transition of responsibilities and maintain continuity of
                    operations, Bock requires employees intending to resign from their positions to
                    provide a written notice period of at least 30 days. This notice period allows the
                    company to identify and recruit a suitable replacement, minimising disruptions to

                    needs and hinders its ability to maintain operational efficiency. <br><br>

                    <b> 26.4 Protecting the Company's Investment in Training and Certifications <br></b>
                    Bock invests significantly in the training and development of its employees, providing
                    them with the skills and knowledge necessary to excel in their roles. To protect its

                    <b> 26.5 Addressing Performance Issues Early On <br> </b>
                    Bock is committed to maintaining a high-performance work environment and expects
                    its employees to meet performance expectations consistently. To address
                    performance issues early on and provide opportunities for improvement, Bock has
                    implemented a performance management system that includes regular performance
                    reviews, feedback sessions, and warnings. If an employee consistently fails to meet
                    performance expectations or demonstrates a lack of commitment to their work, they
                    may receive warnings. Warnings serve as a formal notification of performance issues
                    and provide an opportunity for improvement. Continued underperformance or lack of
                    improvement after receiving warnings may result in disciplinary action, up to and
                    including termination of employment. Termination is a last resort and is taken only
                    when an employee's performance or behaviour is detrimental to the company's
                    overall success. <br><br>

                    <b> 26.6 Additional Expectations and Guidelines <br> </b>
                    In addition to the specific rules outlined above, Bock also expects employees to
                    adhere to the following general expectations and guidelines: <br>
                    ● Professionalism and Courtesy: Employees are expected to conduct
                    themselves in a professional and courteous manner at all times, both inside
                    and outside the workplace. This includes maintaining a positive attitude,
                    treating colleagues and customers with respect, and refraining from using
                    inappropriate language or behaviour. <br>
                    ● Responsible Use of Company Property: Employees must respect the
                    company's property and equipment and use them responsibly. This includes
                    using company equipment only for work-related purposes, taking care to
                    prevent damage or misuse, and reporting any issues promptly. <br>
                    ● Zero Tolerance for Harassment and Discrimination: Bock has a zero-tolerance
                    policy for any form of harassment, discrimination, or bullying. Employees are
                    expected to treat each other with respect and dignity, regardless of their race,
                    gender, religion, sexual orientation, or any other personal characteristic. Any
                    violation of this policy will result in prompt and severe disciplinary action. <br>
                    ● Compliance with Laws and Regulations: Employees must comply with all
                    applicable laws and regulations, both at work and in their personal lives. This
                    includes obeying traffic laws, adhering to company safety policies, and
                    refraining from illegal activities. <br> <br>
                    By adhering to these general rules and expectations, employees can contribute to a
                    positive, productive, and respectful work culture at Bock. These guidelines promote
                    open communication, responsible behaviour, a commitment to the company's
                    success, and a culture of continuous learning and improvement. Bock reserves the
                    right to modify or amend these general rules at any time, as deemed necessary to
                    maintain a productive and respectful work environment.

                    Bock is committed to maintaining a positive and productive work environment for all
                    employees. However, the company may need to terminate an employee's
                    employment under certain circumstances. This document outlines the termination
                    procedures that Bock will follow to ensure a fair and consistent process for all
                    employees. <br><br>

                    <b> 27.1 Reasons for Termination <br></b>

                    Bock may terminate an employee's employment for cause, which means that the
                    termination is justified by the employee's actions or behaviour. Examples of cause for
                    termination include, but are not limited to: <br>
                    ● Violation of Company Policies or Procedures: Failure to comply with
                    established company policies, procedures, or guidelines, including but not
                    limited to safety regulations, harassment policies, and confidentiality
                    agreements. <br>
                    ● Unsatisfactory Performance: Consistent inability to meet job expectations,
                    performance targets, or quality standards, despite adequate training, support,
                    and opportunities for improvement. <br>
                    ● Misconduct or Insubordination: Engaging in behaviour that is disruptive,
                    disrespectful, or harmful to the workplace environment, such as
                    insubordination, harassment, bullying, or violence. <br>
                    ● Gross Negligence or Incompetence: Demonstrating a lack of care or attention
                    to duties, resulting in significant errors, accidents, or losses for the company. <br>
                    ● Failure to Meet Employment Requirements: Failure to maintain the necessary
                    qualifications, licences, or certifications required for the position. <br>
                    ● Criminal Activity or Conviction of a Crime: Engaging in illegal activities or
                    being convicted of a crime that reflects poorly on the company's reputation or
                    poses a risk to the safety of employees or customers. <br><br>

                    <b> 27.2 Termination Process <br></b>

                    If Bock decides to terminate an employee's employment, the following process will
                    be followed: <br>
                    1. Verbal Warning: There will be 5 verbal warnings. Every time the employee will be
                    verbally informed of the reason for the potential termination and given an opportunity
                    to improve their performance or address the issue at hand. <br>
                    2. Written Warning: If the employee's behaviour or performance does not improve, a
                    written warning will be issued, formally documenting the issue and outlining the
                    consequences of further misconduct or unsatisfactory performance. <br>
                    3. Final Warning: If the employee's behaviour or performance remains unsatisfactory,
                    a final warning will be issued, stating that further violations or failures to improve will
                    result in termination of employment. <br>
                    4. Termination Meeting: If the employee's behaviour or performance does not
                    improve after the final warning, a termination meeting will be conducted. The
                    employee will be informed of the decision to terminate their employment, and the
                    reason for termination will be explained. The employee will be provided with the
                    necessary paperwork and information regarding severance pay, benefits
                    continuation, and other relevant matters. <br><br>

                    <b> 27.3 Exit Interview <br></b>

                    Bock encourages all departing employees to participate in an exit interview. The exit
                    interview provides an opportunity for the employee to share their feedback about
                    their experience at Bock, identify areas for improvement, and address any
                    outstanding concerns. The company values this feedback as it helps to improve its
                    overall practices and create a more positive and productive work environment for all
                    employees.

                    employees may file a formal grievance through the company's grievance
                    procedure. Grievances will be reviewed and addressed promptly. <br>
                    3. Mediation and Arbitration: In the event of unresolved disputes, mediation or
                    arbitration may be offered to facilitate a mutually agreeable resolution.
